Every few months I audit my tooling and ask one question: *Does this help me think, or does it ask for attention?* The keepers all have the same traits—predictable, scriptable, and friendly to asynchronous collaboration.

- **Astro for content sites.** Static output, zero server fuss, and easy slots for modern integrations like Utterances.
- **GitHub Actions for deployments.** One workflow per project, kept visible in the repo so fixes stay versioned with the code.
- **Linear and Issues over chat approvals.** Written context beats “LGTM” in a Slack thread every single time.

I am not dogmatic, but I do try to bias toward tools that treat calm as a feature. This site is proof: clone it, run `npm run dev`, and you get a fast local environment with no mystery services attached.
