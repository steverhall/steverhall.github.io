I have written in private notebooks for years, but the things I'm most proud of—steady engineering practices, thoughtful product bets, odd experiments that actually shipped—were effectively invisible on the web. This site fixes that. It gives me a place to document the decisions behind my work instead of just showing the finished products.

In practical terms, the home page will surface whatever I'm actively pursuing, the about page explains how I think, and this blog is the running commentary. Expect a mix of architecture notes, tiny tools I publish on GitHub, and periodic retros on launches that went well (or sideways).

If you're curious about something specific, reach out on GitHub. Otherwise, feel free to subscribe to the RSS feed or drop a comment via Utterances below—it's all wired up and open.
