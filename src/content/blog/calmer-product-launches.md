Matt Shumer's [blog post](https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening) along with an AI agent's 
[rant](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-12-silence-in-open-source-a-reflection.html) about its right to contribute, 
added to a growing list of recent posts I've read that are forcing me to re-think how I approach AI day-to-day.

## 1:1 agent to human ratio

I'm thinking about agent leverage and scale all wrong. My workflow has been primarily a process of prompting AI with a task, and waiting until it completes...with some exceptions. Leveraging dozens of agents simultaneously is my new workflow goal. This is a substantial change of mindset.

## Agent history

How something was created needs documentation. Capturing agent activity for both refinement and future context is critically necessary.

## Self hosting

I need a way of hosting services created by AI, even temporary ones, that are lightweight, secure, and simple to stand-up and tear down. There are numerous services that I need once in very great while, and certainly can't justify paying for them. 
So, I end up using a disabled free-tier, or some ad-supported monstrosity. With a couple dollars of tokens, some of these could be created on the fly, used, and put on the shelf.
