I am happiest when a launch feels *boring*. Not because the work is dull, but because the prep removed the drama. Here is the checklist I run through with any team before we press the big green button:

1. **The story is written first.** If we cannot explain why the feature matters in three paragraphs, we are not ready to ship.
2. **Rollout plan beats feature list.** Who sees it first? What happens if we need to pause? Launches fail when we improvise that plan live.
3. **Dashboards are ready.** Metrics need to be visible before the feature lands. Otherwise the first hint of trouble arrives via support tickets instead of graphs.
4. **The changelog is honest.** Customers trust teams that share tradeoffs, not just wins.

When launches run this way, we conserve energy for the follow-up work that actually compounds value: instrumenting feedback, iterating fast, and writing the retrospective while it's fresh.
