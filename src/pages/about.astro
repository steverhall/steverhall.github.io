	<p>
		I'm Steve Hall—an engineering leader who cares about calm products, reliable infrastructure, and
		good stories around both. I have spent the last decade rotating between hands-on architecture and
		product strategy, usually inside early teams where the line between the two disappears.
	</p>
	<p>
		These are the principles I keep returning to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Write it down.</strong> Specs, rollback plans, and retros are part of the product, not paperwork.</li>
		<li><strong>Bias toward stable systems.</strong> Measure the blast radius, then choose the boring solution on purpose.</li>
		<li><strong>Ship narrative, not features.</strong> Customers buy into stories about progress, not toggle lists.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Recently I've led platform modernization efforts, stewarded multi-quarter product launches, and
		mentored engineers who now run their own teams. When I'm not doing that, I'm usually tinkering
		with small tools (this site is one of them) or scribbling in a Muji notebook.
	</p>

		You can reach me on <a href="https://github.com/steverhall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>
		or drop a comment on any post below. I'm always up for trading notes about trustworthy systems and
		ways to build them without burning everyone out.
